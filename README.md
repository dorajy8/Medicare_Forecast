# Medicaid Enrollment and Expenditure Forecasting

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of recent and historical trends in U.S. Medicaid enrollment and expenditures, with a specific focus on both the national level and the state of California. The primary goal is to understand the key drivers of growth and to generate data-driven forecasts for the next decade.

The analysis uses historical data to model past trends and projects future changes, acknowledging the significant impacts of legislative actions like the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and public health events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Analysis:
Trend Analysis: Examination of historical data from the 1970s to the present to identify key periods of growth and volatility in Medicaid enrollment and spending.

Time-Series Forecasting: Application of the Prophet statistical forecasting model to project future trends for both enrollment and expenditures through 2034.

Comparative Analysis: A dual focus on nationwide trends and a detailed case study of California's Medicaid program (Medi-Cal).

## Methodology
The forecasting models in this project were built using Prophet, a time-series forecasting library developed by Facebook. This model was chosen for its ability to effectively handle trends, changepoints, and the inherent patterns present in the historical data.

While the statistical models provide a robust baseline, the project conclusion emphasizes that these forecasts do not account for external factors such as future policy changes, economic conditions, or population dynamics.
